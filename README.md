A crud application for flashcard review that ingratiates itself to the adherents of [differentiated learning](https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/classroom-resources/examples-of-differentiated-instruction/) philosophies.

## Hypothesis

## Approach 
* Provide users with the ability to customise flashcard review to a preffered learning style. The following learning styles will be available:
1. Read and write - basic style in which users will review basic flashcards with little to no feedback
2. Visual - Flashcards will be flashy as will the feedback so as to enhance the visual experience and retention
3. Auditory/Aural - Users will be able to speak their responses and here the feedback.
